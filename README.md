# nodeapi

> Inspired by [godoc](http://golang.org/cmd/godoc/), a pretty useful tool in [Go](http://golang.org), which can let developer check the api document easily. Just hope node can have one in the core, but do it myself at this time.

## Usage

`npm install -g nodeapi`

```
nodeapi [options]

options:
  -m, --module: Which module document you want to see.
  -e, --method: Which method document you want to see.
  -l, --list: List all modules name.
```

## Todo

* Beauty document format
* Fetch specific version document
* Cache document for reuse
